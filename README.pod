=head1 ical-to-google-calendar

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A simple Perl script to parse an iCal-format (.ics) file, and update a Google
Calendar with it, via the Google Calendar API.

=head1 WHY?

Why not just add the iCal feed URL to Google Calendar and let them handle it?

Because they update horribly slowly (expect about once every 24 hours).

Calendaring is a time-sensitive thing; I don't want to wait a full day for
updates to take effect (by the time Google re-fetch the feed and update my
calendar, it could be too late!).


=head1 CONFIGURATION

The script will read your Google account details from C<~/.netrc>, where you
should specify them as e.g.:

    machine calendar.google.com
    login yourgoogleusername
    password supersecretpassword

Of course, you'll want to ensure that file is well protected.


=head1 USAGE

    ./ical-to-gcal --calendar 'Calendar Name' ical_url

The script will fetch the iCal calendar feed, then for each event in it,
add/update an event in your Google Calendar (the ID from the iCal feed is added
in the extra data of the event in the Google Calendar, so the script can match
them up next time).
